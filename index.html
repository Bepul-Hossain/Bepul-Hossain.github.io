          This topic contains the following modules, in a suggested order for
          working through them. You should definitely start with the first one.
          CSS first steps CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and lay
          out web pages — for example, to alter the font, color, size, and
          spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add
          animations and other decorative features. This module provides a
          gentle beginning to your path towards CSS mastery with the basics of
          how it works, what the syntax looks like, and how you can start using
          it to add styling to HTML. CSS building blocks This module carries on
          where CSS first steps left off — now you've gained familiarity with
          the language and its syntax, and got some basic experience with using
          it, its time to dive a bit deeper. This module looks at the cascade
          and inheritance, all the selector types we have available, units,
          sizing, styling backgrounds and borders, debugging, and lots more. The
          aim here is to provide you with a toolkit for writing competent CSS
          and help you understand all the essential theory, before moving on to
          more specific disciplines like text styling and CSS layout. Styling
          text With the basics of the CSS language covered, the next CSS topic
          for you to concentrate on is styling text — one of the most common
          things you'll do with CSS. Here we look at text styling fundamentals,
          including setting font, boldness, italics, line and letter spacing,
          drop shadows and other text features. We round off the module by
          looking at applying custom fonts to your page, and styling lists and
          links. CSS layout At this point we've already looked at CSS
          fundamentals, how to style text, and how to style and manipulate the
          boxes that your content sits inside. Now it's time to look at how to
          place your boxes in the right place in relation to the viewport, and
          one another. We have covered the necessary prerequisites so we can now
          dive deep into CSS layout, looking at different display settings,
          modern layout tools like flexbox, CSS grid, and positioning, and some
          of the legacy techniques you might still want to know about.

        your path towards CSS mastery with the basics of how it works, what the
        syntax looks like, and how you can start using it to add styling to
        HTML. CSS building blocks This module carries on where CSS first steps
        left off — now you've gained familiarity with the language and its
        syntax, and got some basic experience with using it, its time to dive a
        bit deeper. This module looks at the cascade and inheritance, all the
        selector types we have available, units, sizing, styling backgrounds and
        borders, debugging, and lots more. The aim here is to provide you with a
        toolkit for writing competent CSS and help you understand all the
        essential theory, before moving on to more specific disciplines like
        text styling and CSS layout. Styling text With the basics of the CSS
        language covered, the next CSS topic for you to concentrate on is
        styling text — one of the most common things you'll do with CSS. Here we
        look at text styling fundamentals, including setting font, boldness,
        italics, line and letter spacing, drop shadows and other text features.
        We round off the module by looking at applying custom fonts to your
        page, and styling lists and links. CSS layout At this point we've
        already looked at CSS fundamentals, how to style text, and how to style
        and manipulate the boxes that your content sits inside. Now it's time to
        look at how to place your boxes in the right place in relation to the
        viewport, and one another. We have covered the necessary prerequisites
        so we can now dive deep into CSS layout, looking at different display
        settings, modern layout tools like flexbox, CSS grid, and positioning,
        and some of the legacy techniques you might still want to know about.

        CSS first steps CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and lay
        out web pages — for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing
        of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and
        other decorative features. This module provides a gentle beginning to
