        This topic contains the following modules, in a suggested order for
        working through them. You should definitely start with the first one.
        CSS first steps CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and lay
        out web pages — for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing
        of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and
        other decorative features. This module provides a gentle beginning to
        your path towards CSS mastery with the basics of how it works, what the
        syntax looks like, and how you can start using it to add styling to
        HTML. CSS building blocks This module carries on where CSS first steps
        left off — now you've gained familiarity with the language and its
        syntax, and got some basic experience with using it, its time to dive a
        bit deeper. This module looks at the cascade and inheritance, all the
        selector types we have available, units, sizing, styling backgrounds and
        borders, debugging, and lots more. The aim here is to provide you with a
        toolkit for writing competent CSS and help you understand all the
        essential theory, before moving on to more specific disciplines like
        text styling and CSS layout. Styling text With the basics of the CSS
        language covered, the next CSS topic for you to concentrate on is
        styling text — one of the most common things you'll do with CSS. Here we
        look at text styling fundamentals, including setting font, boldness,
        italics, line and letter spacing, drop shadows and other text features.
        We round off the module by looking at applying custom fonts to your
        page, and styling lists and links. CSS layout At this point we've
        already looked at CSS fundamentals, how to style text, and how to style
        and manipulate the boxes that your content sits inside. Now it's time to
        look at how to place your boxes in the right place in relation to the
        viewport, and one another. We have covered the necessary prerequisites
        so we can now dive deep into CSS layout, looking at different display
        settings, modern layout tools like flexbox, CSS grid, and positioning,
        and some of the legacy techniques you might still want to know about.

        borders, debugging, and lots more. The aim here is to provide you with a
        toolkit for writing competent CSS and help you understand all the
        essential theory, before moving on to more specific disciplines like
        text styling and CSS layout. Styling text With the basics of the CSS
        language covered, the next CSS topic for you to concentrate on is
        styling text — one of the most common things you'll do with CSS. Here we
        look at text styling fundamentals, including setting font, boldness,
        italics, line and letter spacing, drop shadows and other text features.
        We round off the module by looking at applying custom fonts to your
        page, and styling lists and links. CSS layout At this point we've
        already looked at CSS fundamentals, how to style text, and how to style
        and manipulate the boxes that your content sits inside. Now it's time to
        look at how to place your boxes in the right place in relation to the
        viewport, and one another. We have covered the necessary prerequisites
        so we can now dive deep into CSS layout, looking at different display
        settings, modern layout tools like flexbox, CSS grid, and positioning,
        and some of the legacy techniques you might still want to know about.
